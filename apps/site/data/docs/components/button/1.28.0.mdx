### Usage

When using the simple Button API, it's as simple as this:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default () => <Button>Lorem ipsum</Button>
```

### Sizing

Sizing buttons provides a unique challenge especially for a compiler, because you need to adjust many different properties - not just on the outer frame, but on the text wrapped inside. Tamagui supports adjusting the padding, border radius, font size and icons sizes all in one with the `size` prop.

```tsx
import { Button } from 'tamagui'

export default () => <Button size="$6">Lorem ipsum</Button>
```

Given your theme defines a size `6`, the button will adjust all of the properties appropriately. You can also pass a plain number to get an arbitrary size.

### Icon Theming

You can pass icons as either elements or components. If passing components, Tamagui will automatically pass the `size` and `color` prop to them based on your theme.

You can [use the source of Button itself](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/button/src/Button.tsx) to see in more detail what variants you can override, and how we use this pattern internally to create our Button component.

### Creating your own Button

Tamagui now has all the features necessary to make creating a custom Button easy enough that you don't really need to use our Button at all as a base.

Learn how to do it with our dedicated guide, [How to Build a Button](/docs/guides/how-to-build-a-button).

<Notice>
  The previous `useButton` API is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It's
  brittle and is easily replaced with the new composable components API as described in
  the guide.
</Notice>

#### A note

We highly recommend "rolling your own" Button using the above guide rather than wrapping the built-in Tamagui Button with `styled()` and adding your own properties. While it will work for the most part, with recent improvements to the `@tamagui/core` style library, we've vastly improved the ability to build components.

The current Button is not using these new techniques, so it has some downsides. For example, it accepts font properties directly on the Button itself, like `color`, which only works directly on the Button JSX usage. If you use it with `styled()`, it will not apply. This is a bug we can fix, but it's an example of the odd behavior we struggled against due to not having the right underlying features ready at the time it was implemented.

Slowly, in future releases, we will first deprecate the font props being used directly on Button in favor of composable components (Button.Text), and then in a release a ways after that we will remove them altogether, which will allow us to bring the Tamagui Button in line with the recommended and improved way to building out a Button. We will keep an option to opt into the legacy behavior for a while after that.

### Button props

Buttons extend Stack views inheriting all the [Tamagui standard props](/docs/intro/props), plus:

<PropsTable
