<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui is a labor of love, a slow burn. It's not something that would ever have been
  made in a rush. And it's infinitely better for that.
</IntroParagraph>

I've worked at several startups. Some my own, a few others. I don't hate them, but in almost all of them, there's a distinct lack of craft. Our industry has been corrupted. Like drag racing, it's all about taping the biggest engine to the smallest body, and hoping you can go faster than anyone else. What happens after the finish line doesn't matter.

We don't talk a lot about the losers of the race. The bright young kids who don't know any better but see lots of smart sounding billionaries telling them "this is the way" before sending them off to toil inhumanely, for pennies, in which 95% of them will explicitly actually make 0, zilch, nada from it.

We don't really especially talk about the middle or lower class kids who get caught in this obsene system. See, the reason many of these billionaires feel safe preaching the startup grind to the unitting, is because they don't understand what it means to be middle class. For the average kid, you can afford spend 5 years pouring your heart out for nothign. You just can't afford to do it again.

And having been through that, I can tell you what a toll it takes. Because after 5 years of crushing grind, your heart is tired. Your hands are sore. And your love for what brought you there will be gone.

I went to Japan, having only traveled a few times outside the country, at the age of 29. It was my first trip to Asia. I was just two and a half years into my startup at the time. To say it impressed me deeply is an understatement. It changed me. It felt like visiting a place where only consienctious, smart, and respectful people lived.

On my drive home from the airport after that trip as I slowed down to four way stop, with nary a car in sight, I saw a Honda SUV rush towards the intersection at my left, blinker on to head in my direction. I had at this point already stopped and eased past the intersection when I noticed the Honda also pulling forward. But at this point I was already far ahead. I hit the gas a bit and easily made it ahead of the car, not thinking much of it other than that they may not have seen me. Instead, I was met with enraged honking by a woman who tailgated me down the entire block, waving and pressing both middle fingers against the front windshield.

Americans are stupid in their messy bravado, their overconfidence and incessant optimism. I didn't truly appreciate it until that trip and that moment on the way home from it, but from then I couldn't help but notice it everywhere. Everyone is impatient here, comically and narcisistically so. It's what makes us good as entrepreneurs, and lousy as neighbors.

But the thing that impressed me most with Japan was how prevolent craft is. Craft is so important to them that I want to spell it with a capital C for the rest of the article. The amount of beautifully intricate, passionately refined shops, restaurants, art, and more that I discovered literally everywhere I walked was stunning. It's something that you could spend a whole day looking for in any modern American city and never find. A truly focused experience. The closest thing we have to it is Apple stores, or the rare hole in the wall restaurant or shop. But in Japan, it's everywhere.
