description: Extend and build custom and optimizable components.

Create a new component by extending an existing one:

```tsx
import { GetProps, Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  name: 'Circle', // useful for debugging, and Component themes
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,
})

// helper to get props for any TamaguiComponent
export type CircleProps = GetProps<typeof Circle>
```

Usage:

```tsx
<Circle x={10} y={10} backgroundColor="red" />
```

Note, `tamagui` and `@tamagui/core` both export many of the same helpers, like styled. If you are using `tamagui`, you don't need to ever add `@tamagui/core` to your package.json or import it and can instead import directly from `tamagui` itself and don't need the following.

You can pass any prop that is supported by the component you are extending, even variants of the parent component. Tamagui will figure out the style props up-front, turn them into classNames, and then pass the non-style props down to the component as defaultProps.

## Variants

Let's add some variants:

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const Circle = styled(Stack, {
  borderRadius: 100_000_000,

  variants: {
    pin: {
      top: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: 0,
      },
    },

    centered: {
      true: {
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      },
    },

    size: {
      '...size': (size, { tokens }) => {
        return {
          width: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
          height: tokens.size[size] ?? size,
        }
      },
    },
  } as const,
})
```

<Notice>
  Please use `as const` for the variants definition until Typescript gains the ability to
  infer generics as const .
</Notice>

We can use these like so:

```tsx
<Circle pin="top" centered size="$lg" />
```

To learn more about to use them and all the special types, [see the docs on variants](/docs/core/variants).

## Using with React Native

If using just `core` but passing in React Native components, be sure to run `setupReactNative` once first, typically near your entry file and give it the components you intend to decorate. This is necessary because React Native has some different behavior from a typical component that we must assume when merging events and styles.

```tsx
import { Image } from 'react-native'
import { setupReactNative, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

// this allows tamagui to optimize for react-native components
// it's not required. `tamagui` automatically sets this up, but core doesn't
setupReactNative({ Image })

const MyImage = styled(Image, {
  backgroundColor: 'red',
})
```

This requirement allows core to be light and not depend on react-native for web-only use cases. The `tamagui` package applies this polyfill automatically as it uses React Native.

### Non-working React Native views

You can assume all "utility" views in React Native are not supported: Pressable, TouchableOpacity, and others. They have specific logic for handling events that conflicts with Tamagui. We could support these in the future, but we don't plan on it - you can get all of Pressable functionality for the most part within Tamagui itself, and if you need something outside of it, you can use Pressable directly.

## Using on the web

The `styled()` function supports Tamagui views, React Native views, and any other React component that accepts a `style` prop. If you wrap an external component that Tamagui doesn't recognize, Tamagui will assume it only supports the `style` prop and not optimize it.

If it does accept `className`, you can opt-in to className, CSS media queries, and compile-time optimization by adding `acceptsClassName`:

```tsx
import { SomeCustomComponent } from 'some-library'
import { styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const TamaguiCustomComponent = styled(SomeCustomComponent, {
  acceptsClassName: true,
})
```

### styleable()

<Notice>
  This is an advanced pattern that is only needed if you are building a design system that
  has complex components.
</Notice>

Any `styled()` component will have a helper function on it called `.styleable()`.

This advanced usage is necessary if you are doing a pattern like the following:

```tsx
const StyledText = styled(Text)

const HigherOrderStyledText = (props) => <StyledText />

const StyledHigherOrderStyledText = styled(HigherOrderStyledText, {
  variants: {
    // variants will merge incorrectly
  },
})
```

So you must add a `.styleable()` around your `HigherOrderStyledText`. You'll also want to forward the ref, which happens automatically with styleable:

```tsx
const StyledText = styled(Text)

const HigherOrderStyledText = StyledText.styleable((props, ref) => (
  <StyledText ref={ref} />
))

const StyledHigherOrderStyledText = styled(HigherOrderStyledText, {
  variants: {
    // variants will merge incorrectly
  },
})
```

Note that theme will automatically now happen above this `HigherOrderStyledText` so it's available if you use `useTheme`.

You also must always return only a single `StyledText` (or null) from this component.
